* create basic shader/effect with noise texture
* add convenience features
    - auto-detect necessary radius and speed based on static "dissolve time" variable
    - use 3D noise to make seamless noise when dissolving?
* make variants
    - with/without noise texture
    - smoke VFX around dissolving parts
    - dripping liquid with decals from dissolving parts
	- version of material with constant radius and source point that updates position over time
    - convert shader to a visual effect for ease of use?
