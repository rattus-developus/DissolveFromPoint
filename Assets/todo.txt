X create basic shader/effect with noise texture
* finish textured version
	X make variable object space
	X make dissolve begin/end within 0.05f of each end of the slider (not fully necessary)
	X add edge glow
	- clean up settings/variables
	- add comments/stickys
	- PERFORMANCE TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION (simplify math? 2 lerps feels weird)
	- create script w/ control modes (also maybe variable descriptions?)
		-- point mode that uses a transform, and radius var. convert world space to object space?
		-- "default" mode expanding from a point on the object using dissolve time float and auto detection
* finish flat version
	- give it all the same features of the textured version
* make visual effect with smoke/dissolve drops and decals
	- multiple dissolve points?
