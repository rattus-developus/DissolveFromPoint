X create basic shader/effect with noise texture
* finish textured version
	X make variable object space
	X make dissolve begin/end within 0.05f of each end of the slider (not fully necessary)
	X add edge glow
	X clean up settings/variables
	X add comments/stickys
	X PERFORMANCE TESTING AND OPTIMIZATION (simplify math? 2 lerps feels weird)
		X distance is probably least performant node, square root.
	X create script w/ control modes (also maybe variable descriptions?)
		X JUST USE 2 scripts. "Dissolve" and "Hot Ball"
		X point mode that uses a transform, and radius var. convert world space to object space?
		X "default" mode expanding from a point on the object using dissolve time float and auto detection
X finish flat version
	X give it all the same features of the textured version
* demo stuff
